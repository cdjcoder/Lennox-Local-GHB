# Setting Up the Email System - PHP Implementation

We've implemented a PHP-based email sending system that should work on most web hosting platforms. This system is simpler to configure than the Node.js version since it doesn't require a separate server.

## Implementation Details:

1. The system uses PHP's built-in `mail()` function, which is supported by most web hosts.
2. Two emails are sent when a form is submitted:
   - One to the website owner (cesarjames@giganteprintmedia.com)
   - A confirmation email to the customer

## Setup Instructions:

1. Make sure your web hosting supports PHP (most do).
2. Upload all files to your web server, maintaining the same directory structure.
3. Confirm that the `send-email.php` file is in the root directory of your website.
4. Test the form by submitting a reservation.

## Troubleshooting:

If emails are not being sent:

1. Check if your web hosting allows PHP's mail() function. Some hosting providers restrict it.
2. Verify that the server's PHP mail configuration is properly set up.
3. Contact your hosting provider to ensure email functionality is enabled.
4. Check your form submission in the browser console (F12) for any JavaScript errors.
5. Check server logs for PHP errors related to the mail() function.

## Alternative Solutions:

If the PHP mail() function doesn't work on your hosting:

1. Consider using a third-party email service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or PHPMailer.
2. Ask your hosting provider about recommended email sending methods.

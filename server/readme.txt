# How to Fix the Email Sending Issue

1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your system

2. Install the backend dependencies:
```
cd server
npm install
```

3. Update the .env file with your actual email credentials:
```
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
PORT=3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080
```

Note: For Gmail, you need to use an App Password, not your regular password.

4. Start the server:
```
npm start
```

5. Now the form will be able to properly communicate with your backend and send emails.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues, check:
1. That your .env file contains valid credentials
2. The server is running on port 3000
3. You have proper network connectivity
4. The console log in your browser for any errors
5. Server logs for any backend errors
